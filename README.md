This project covers a TinyML application that uses low-cost sensor data to predict temperature and humidity from expensive sensors. 

The main goal is to improve the performance of cost-effective sensors through AI neural networks to obtain measurement results similar to those of expensive sensors. 

The project involves data collection, training a neural network model, evaluating results, and quantizing the model. We present efficient data management and sensor cost reduction using TinyML.




## ðŸª¢Summary
- Low-sensitivity sensor data processing: Processes data collected from low-power and low-sensitivity environmental sensors.
- TinyML model implementation: Implements a lightweight machine learning model to predict temperature and humidity data.
- Data reinforcement and prediction: Predict temperature and humidity changes based on collected data and improve prediction accuracy.
