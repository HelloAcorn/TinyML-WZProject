# ðŸ“ŒTinyML-HygroPredict
This project covers how to improve the performance difference between high-cost sensors and low-cost sensors using neural networks. The authors note that the humidity measured by the company's low-cost sensors differed significantly from higher-cost sensors. To solve this, the authors present a method to improve the performance of low-cost sensors by training a neural network model based on data collected using multiple low-cost sensors. As a result of the experiment, the neural network succeeded in predicting data from low-cost sensors similar to data from high-cost sensors, which is meaningful in that it suggests a way to maintain accuracy while reducing sensor costs. Additionally, the process of using TinyML for efficient data management and model quantization is described.
## ðŸª¢Summary
- Low-sensitivity sensor data processing: Processes data collected from low-power and low-sensitivity environmental sensors.
- TinyML model implementation: Implements a lightweight machine learning model to predict temperature and humidity data.
- Data reinforcement and prediction: Predict temperature and humidity changes based on collected data and improve prediction accuracy.
